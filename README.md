When you start the game you'll be able to choose your language. Just type en/pl/ru (en is default) and hit enter.
After the game language you can choose how big the game field will be. Write down the width, hit enter, and then same with height. (Any values from 6 to 64).

There is different objects on the map:

Your hero is represented on the map as a star sign.
Hash sign is monsters that you can fight, they drop coins somewhere on the map after death, and sometimes health potions.
Copyright sign is coins, collect them!
Caret sign is a trap that deals damage if you step on it. Trap damage depends on on your health.
Dollar sign is a shopkeeper, you'll be able to buy armor from her as soon as you get enough coins.

Armor decreases damage you get, health potions heal you.

Final goal of the game is to collect 100 coins to save your land.
